## local setup instructions

1: fork this repo.

2: run these commands to set up a local copy:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/kiraton.git
git branch <your username>
git checkout <your username>
python3 -m http.server &
```

3: then in your browser, go to `0.0.0.0:8000`. (or to `127.0.0.1:8000`,
both should work)

4: if you have changes you'd like to contribute, set up a pull request

start to avoid potential wasted time on your part).
