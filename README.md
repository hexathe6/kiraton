# kiraton
NOTE: THIS IS *VERY* UNFINISHED
-------------------------------

kiraton is/will be a 2d rts game inspired by achikaps, so play that
while you're waiting for this.

gameplay
--------

none, yet

there will be stuff like
 - programmable units
 - resource management
 - semi-realistic crafting recipes
 - lots of building types and items
 - unit equipment (maybe)

contributors
------------

me, and please don't contribute any code until the note at the top
says it's at least prealpha.

however, if you want to play with it locally anyway, here's how to do
that. (don't copy the `> `s, they aren't part of the command)

```
> git clone https://github.com/hexathe6/kiraton.git
> git branch <your username>
> git checkout <your username>
> python3 -m http.server &
```

then in your browser, go to `0.0.0.0:8000`. (or to `127.0.0.1:8000`,
both should work)
