## gameplay

### current 
none, yet, but it has a few minor features!
 - tabs!
   - and subtabs, because you can never have too much nesting
 - building selection
 - a font changer

there will be stuff like
 - programmable units
 - resource management
 - semi-realistic crafting recipes
 - lots of building types and items
 - unit equipment (maybe)
